***What does it do?***

This program utilizes the Coinbase Pro Sandbox API to autonomously execute a selection of functions, such as: placing a market buy order, a sell order, checking the 24-hour price percentage change, and more. This is made even easier by allowing the user to control these functions from an attractive and functional Graphical User Interface (GUI). In addition, this hands-off investing approach allows a user to limit their emotions when investing and spend more time doing other activities. Directly put, this program makes trading stress-free and more time efficient.

***Tech used***

Python, Pandas, PysSimpleGUI, Requests, JSON, Jupyter Notebook, and, CoinBase Pro Sandbox API

***What did I learn?***

Throughout this project, I faced many different challenges but I overcame them and learned a lot along the way. Firstly, I solved how to access and use the APIs requests/functions such as placing a market order trade. This is something I had not done before so I had to do a lot of reading and self-learning on how to utilize it effectively. If I did not solve this I would not be able to access my Coinbase Pro Trading Exchange account.

Secondly, I had to learn about WebSockets and how they are useful. For my project, they were essential, without a functional WebSocket I would not have been able to access real-time market data, therefore making my project obsolete.

Thirdly, after some time and thinking, I realized my program is not very user-friendly. To solve this challenge I created a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The goal of this was to give the user the choice of when to execute certain functions in an easier manner than calling a certain function in the command line terminal. To make the GUI more appealing I gave it a unique style. 
 The Python package I used to create the GUI was called PySimpleGUI. I had not heard of this package before so I had to teach myeslf about it by reading the documentation. 

Overall, I learnt a lot of new tech skills and how to think like a user and provide solutions to potential future problems.
